The receipt system used the principles of object-oriented programming to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
The key components of the system include the Customer, Item, Payment, Receipt, and Store classes, which encapsulate different
attributes and behaviors. Polymorphism was exercised in the Payment class, through the subclasses CashPayment and CardPayment,
which allows different payment methods to be dealt with flexibly. Encapsulation ensures the integrity of the data, where methods such as addReceipt
and addItem safely manage the association of receipts, customers, and stores. The receipts will be categorized according to the
store types (electronics, grocery, etc.) in order to facilitate the spending analysis, while tax calculations will be integrated into the
Receipt class with a configurable tax rate. Error handling mechanisms are included to validate inputs, such as restricting cases where a
particular customer or store has already been added; other validations are applied by ensuring item prices and quantities are valid numeric inputs.
Reports are designed to summarize various overall spending categorized by either store or customer based on a clear relationship among classes.
The program presents a friendly user interface to compile receipts, view them categorized by customer or store, and generate detailed reports.
This is a comprehensive, efficient design of a receipt management system.
